## Step 0 (optional): create a self signed CA certificate with openssl

- Create basic CA folder

```bash
mkdir CA
cd CA
```

- Create basic RSA key and Certificate Signature Request that will work as a CA

```bash
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -out ca.csr -keyout ca.key
```

- Complete the data with whatever you consider insteresting to have in your CA
- Sign your Certificate Signature Request with your key and emit your first certificate

```bash
openssl x509 -trustout -signkey ca.key -days 1461 -req -in ca.csr -out ca.pem
```

- You now have 3 files:

```bash
ca.key -> your CA private key
ca.csr -> certificate signature request
ca.pem -> your CA trusted public certificate
```

## Step 1: create your TSA certificate and private key with openssl

- Create basic tsa folder

```bash
mkdir tsa
cd tsa
```

- Create another RSA private key

```bash
openssl genrsa -out client.key 4096
```

- On osx we will need a basic openssl configuration with a little tweaks

```bash
cat /System/Library/OpenSSL/openssl.cnf > ext.config
echo "[ tsa ]" >> ext.config
echo "extendedKeyUsage=critical,timeStamping" >> ext.config
```

- Create a configuration file with the timestamping extensions

```bash
echo "extendedKeyUsage=critical,timeStamping" >> ext-only.config
```

- Create a certificate signature request with the TSA extension configuration file

```bash
openssl req -new -key client.key -out client.csr -nodes -days 1461 -extensions 'tsa' -config ./ext.config
```

- Sign the request with your CA using the timestamper configuration file

```bash
openssl x509 -req -days 1641 -in client.csr -CA ../CA/ca.pem -CAkey ../CA/ca.key -set_serial 01 -out client.crt -extfile ext-only.config
```

- Validate by printing the certificate information

```bash
openssl x509 -text -in client.crt
```

- Look for timestamping critical extensions:

```
X509v3 extensions:
    X509v3 Extended Key Usage: critical
        Time Stamping
```

## Step 2: import your openssl generated timestamper keypair and certificate with java keytool
- Export the tsa certificate with openssl with the whole chain (the password should be longer than 6 chars)

```bash
openssl pkcs12 -export -out tsa.p12 -inkey client.key -in client.crt -CAfile ../CA/ca.pem -chain
```

- Print the certificates in the keystore:

```bash
keytool -list -keystore tsa.p12 -v -storetype PKCS12
```

- Change the alias for a valid alias

```bash
keytool -changealias -keystore tsa.p12 -storetype pkcs12 -alias 1 -destalias timestamping-cert
```

- Check it again just to be sure
